/*! \brief This class is the base class for chemicals which influnce the dynamics of bacterium.

 E. coli cells swim toward

 - amino acids (serine and aspartic acid),
 - sugars (maltose, ribose, galactose, glucose),
 - dipeptides,
 - pyrimidines
 - electron acceptors (oxygen, nitrate, fumarate).

 E. coli also swims away from potentially noxious chemicals, such as

 - alcohols
 - fatty acids,

 This class can be used as a specification af all the substance or just an average chemical that the bacterium actually 'measures' (such as the FunzC and derived classes in EcoliSimulator_4.x.x)
